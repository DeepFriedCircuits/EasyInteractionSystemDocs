The **Unlocker** works like the :ref:`state-forcer` but only locks or unlocks the target(s) interaction state.

.. note::
    This actor is a nice way to connect two interactives in a visual way.
    For instance, you may have a door in your level that needs to be unlocked
    via a button somewhere else. This is how you could handle that interaction.
